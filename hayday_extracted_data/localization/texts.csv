TID_FAQ_QUESTION_2,Q: I lost my farm. How can I get it back?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_2,"A: We recommend that you play only one farm per device, and that you attach your farm to your own Game Center or Supercell ID account. If you load multiple farms on a single device, you may lose access to one or all of the accounts. If you have lost your farm, contact our Player Support using the \qReport an issue\q button below. Don't forget to provide the old farm's name and level!",
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_2_ANDROID,"A: We recommend that you play only one farm per device, and that you attach your farm to your own Google Play or Supercell ID account.

Don't forget to provide the old farm's name and level!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_3,Q: I can't buy Diamonds. Please help!,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_3,"A: Problems with purchasing Diamonds or coins are usually temporary. Try making a purchase again in a couple of hours! Also, make sure that In-App Purchases are enabled on your device and that you are running the latest version of iOS. If the problem persists, please contact our Player Support Team using the \qReport an issue\q button below.",

If the problem persists, please contact our Player Support Team using the \qReport an issue\q button below.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_4,Q: How do I get more Diamonds?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_4,"A: You can earn Diamonds from achievements and by increasing your level. You can also find them randomly in mystery boxes and the mine. Visiting other farms gives you a chance to find more mystery boxes. Remember, you can also purchase Diamonds!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_5,Q: I ran out of wheat or some other crop! How do I get more?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_5,"A: If you planted all of your seeds from a particular crop, you will have to wait for it to grow. If you have none left in your silo or growing, you can use Diamonds to purchase more of that crop, visit Greg or a friend and buy that crop from their roadside shops, or look in the newspaper for someone selling the crop!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_6,Q: I harvested some crops and they are not in my silo!,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_6,"A: When you plant crops, seeds are taken directly from your silo. For example, if you have 6 wheat in the silo and plant 3 wheat, you will only have 3 wheat left to use for production or delivery. It may happen that when players harvest crops, they immediately plant them again. This may be the reason why the crops seem to get lost. Just wait for them to grow in the fields, and you will have plenty again!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_7,Q: How do I feed my animals? How do I feed my pets?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_7,"A: You need a Feed Mill to produce feed for your animals. The Feed Mill is available from the Shop under the Buildings tab. After building the mill, tap it and drag the type of animal feed you need to the production queue. Animal feed is made from basic crops, so plant and harvest more if you need to. To feed your pets, tap on the dog house / cat house or stable, and then drag the food onto it.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_8,Q: Help! My pet is no longer in my farm!,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_8,"A: Sometimes pets are hidden behind a tree or stuck behind a building! If you tap on the pet house and drag the whistle to the top of it, all your pets should run back to their houses immediately!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_9,"Q: Where do I find indigo, pumpkins, pizza and chocolate cake?",
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_9,"A: Once your level is high enough to grow Indigo and other advanced crops, you can find them as follows:\n\n1) tap an empty patch of field - the crop menu opens\n2) tap the little switch button (with two arrows) at the bottom left corner of the crop menu\n3) plant the crop you want by dragging it onto the field\nTo access your basic crops like wheat, carrots etc., just tap the switch button again",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_10,Q: How do trees and bushes work?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_10,"A: Unlike other crops, Trees and Bushes don't require fields to grow. Instead, you can plant them almost anywhere on your farm! They have a limited life span, however, meaning that you can only harvest them three times. After three harvests, the tree or bush wilts, and needs special tending. You can ask your friends for help in reviving your wilted trees and bushes, which allows you to get one more harvest before the tree or bush wilts permanently. After that, the tree or bush must be chopped down to make room for new ones.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_11,"Q: I have plenty of cherries, but I can't make popsicles!",
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_11,"A: If you want to produce popsicles, you need to have cherry juice in store, not only cherries.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_12,Q: Why does it take so long to make some products?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_12,"A: Some of the products are more valuable, and therefore it takes longer to produce them.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_13,Q: My barn/silo is full! How do I make room?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_13,"A: You can sell items, use them in production or expand your barn and silo storage. When you're selling items at your Roadside Shop, tap the Barn/Silo symbol to open the Barn and Silo tab. This allows you to sell items stored in your barn or silo and make more space. You can use your items in any of of your production buildings to make more room. Alternatively, you can gather building materials and increase the size of your barn and silo to allow more items to be stored there.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_14,"Q: Where do I find axes, saws, expansions and building materials?",
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_14,"A: You can find upgrade & expansion materials (Nails, Planks, Mallets etc.), Axes, Saws, Shovels, TNT and Dynamite from mystery boxes, in the newspaper if someone is selling them, as random bonus items when you harvest your crops or pick up your products, randomly in the Wheel Of Fortune or you can purchase them with Diamonds! Note that Tom can look for Axes, Saws, TNT, Dynamite and Shovels from the market, but not upgrade or expansion materials.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_15,Q: Why are some tools/items impossible to find?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_15,"A: Some tools or items are particularly valuable and they may be difficult to find. Levelling up and unlocking new areas or levels for your buildings may be challenging at times, but it is always extremely rewarding!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_16,Q: I see that some people have a ticket next to the postbox. How can I get it?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_16,A: The movie ticket is a feature that is assigned to a random group of players and they may appear & disappear from the farms at any time. I hope you get your chance soon!,
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_17,Q: How do I add friends to my friends bar?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_17,"A: The Friends Bar shows you both previously added Game Center and Supercell ID friends who play Hay Day. Unfortunately, it is no longer possible to add more new Game Center friends due to recent changes to Game Center. Logging into your Supercell ID account from Hay Day automatically adds all your friends who play Hay Day to your Friends Bar. Make sure you connect to Supercell ID via game settings!",
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_17_ANDROID,A: The Friends Bar shows your Supercell ID friends that play Hay Day. Logging into your Supercell ID account from Hay Day automatically adds all your friends who play Hay Day to your Friends Bar. Make sure you connect to your Supercell ID account via game settings!,
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_18,Q: How do I delete friends from my friends bar?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_18,"A: You can no longer delete a single Game Center friend from your friend´s list, only all of them from the device settings. However you can still delete one or more friends from your Supercell ID friends list.",
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_18_ANDROID,"A: If you want to delete a friend from your friend's list, you have to remove them from your Supercell ID friends list.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_19,Q: How do I delete followers?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_19,"A: If you followed a farm and you want to unfollow it, just visit it and tap on the \qbookmark\q icon next to the farmer's avatar. To delete followers, simply tap and hold on the follower icon and then select which ones you want to be removed. When that's done, tap on the X icon and follow instructions.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_20,Q: How do I get thank you letters?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_20,"A: To get thank you letters, help out your friends with their boat orders, trees and bushes. When you do, they will have the option to send you a thank you note for your help. Not everyone will! Whenever a friend needs help, you will see a yellow exclamation near their boat or next to trees and bushes that need water.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_21,Q: How do I send thank you letters?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_21,"A: You can send thank you letters when your friends help you fill a boat crate or water your trees and bushes! Just tap on the boat crate closed by a friend or on the icon that appears on top of revived trees and bushes, then tap again. You will see a small envelope fly away. Your letter was sent!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_22,"Q: I got some thank you letters, but when I collected them, only a few were counted!",
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_22,"A: When you press the \qcollect all\q button, you collect gift cards, not thank you letters. Please note that not all the thank you letters have a gift card inside.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_23,Q: How does the fishing work?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_23,"A: If you want to know how to fish, just tap on Angus the fisherman at anytime and the tutorial will teach you how to catch amazing fish!",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_25,Q: Does Hay Day post on my Facebook timeline without my permission?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_25,"A: No, Hay Day never posts on Facebook without your express permission.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_26,Q: I noticed that I am missing Diamonds! I lost Diamonds! Where are they?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_26,"A: In most cases the lost Diamonds are actually used to speed up production, animals, buildings etc., and sometimes by mistake. In some cases family members or friends who have access to your device may also play the game without your knowledge.",

Reputation points are required to upgrade your buildings in town, to buy new Service buildings and to unlock new features in the Town area.",
TID_FAQ_QUESTION_45,Q: Town: How does my personal train work?,
TID_FAQ_ANSWER_45,"A: The personal train unlocks at reputation level 4. Visit your neighborhood friends' towns and use your personal train to pick up visitors from their platforms. Visitors go to the platform when you complete all their requests or use the send away button. But you have to be quick: if the Eggspress train arrives before your neighborhood friend, it will pick all visitors from the platform and take the visitors home. Each visitor can visit at most two player towns before going home.",

Fulfilling any request always rewards you with random tokens.\n\nRequests have a timer after which they expire, and another request will take its place.

Other players can help repairing your truck, or you can wait until the repair timer runs out.",Cannot yet be tested

Be quick: they have timers, and disappear once time runs out.\n\nIf a chicken appears on the Daily Quests bar, complete all the day´s quests and collect it!

The exclusive contents will only be available for purchase once the Valley Season ends.\n\n\nOn the Valley map you can see notices for important things, such as a chicken by the road, a group request, or another player´s broken truck.\n\nIf another player´s truck breaks down, you can repair their truck by driving onto their same road stop. You get random tokens for your kindness!",Cannot yet be tested
